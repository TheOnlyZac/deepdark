#DeepDark

A text-based browser game I've been working on since June 2016.

All game actions are performed by clicking one of the buttons below the text section or, in certain situations, clicking entries in the text section itself.

For debugging purposes, clicking any of the status variables will increment them, and shift clicking will decrement them.
